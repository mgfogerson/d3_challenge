In this project, I used the D3 library in JavaScript to create SVG charts displaying the relationship between average income and lack of healthcare in all 50 US states. The chart pulls data from a 2014 dataset provided by the US Census, and charts each state as an SVG circle. The circles all contain nonreactive text that can be hovered over to make the circle expand, increase opacity, and display a tooltip.  
  In creating this chart, the greatest struggle was deciding how to make my circular data points distinct when the data for many states was clustering in the same area. As well, the text element of the SVG, which shows the state's abbreviation, was interfering with the mouseover feature until I discovered setting the text to non-reactive in CSS. All of these problems were solvable using online documentation and looking through D3's example charts on their website (https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery).

  This is the chart on my current website, https://mgfogerson.github.io/projects/d3statechart with some slightly different CSS rules.
